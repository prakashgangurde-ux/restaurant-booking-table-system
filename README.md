## Setup Instructions

### 1. Python Environment Setup
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# For Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Firebase Configuration
Make sure you have your `serviceAccountKey.json` file in the restaurant_admin directory.

### 3. Running the Application

#### Admin Panel (Backend)
```bash
cd restaurant_admin
python app.py
```
The admin panel will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

#### Customer Interface (Frontend)
For the customer-facing website, it's recommended to:
1. Navigate to the `customer_web_app` folder.
2. Right-click `index.html` and "Open with Browser".

## Important Notes
- Always run the web application from the project's folder
- Keep the admin panel (Flask backend) running while using the customer interface
- Make sure both the frontend and backend servers are running simultaneously
- The admin interface is accessible through VS Code
- Use different ports for frontend (5500) and backend (5000) to avoid conflicts

## Troubleshooting
- If you get module not found errors, ensure you've activated the virtual environment
- If Firebase connection fails, verify your serviceAccountKey.json is properly configured
- For CORS issues, ensure both servers are running and properly configured
